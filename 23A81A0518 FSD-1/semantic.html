              established in the year 2002 with an intake of 60 seats in UG-

              "E" s stand for Excellence, Expertise and Efficiency of this
              department. The cardinal priority is to give the students real
              time experience and help them learn the true functional elements
              of ELECTRICAL & ELECTRON ICS. In its journey of 21 years, it has
              put many assiduous efforts in providing such training to the
              students. Although Electrical Engineering is a field of
              engineering that generally deals with the study and application of
              electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism, our department has
              made enormous efforts to give an extra mileage to the students by
              training them on software design and hardware-software integration
              so as to create more space for them in the job market.
